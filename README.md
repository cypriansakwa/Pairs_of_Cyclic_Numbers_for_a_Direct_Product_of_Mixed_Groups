This Rust code consists of multiple functions that work together to find and output pairs of cyclic numbers (n,m) up to a certain limit such that the group Z_n x Z*_m is cyclic. 
Here's an overview of the functions and their responsibilities:
1. Prime Check which checks if a number is prime.
2. Valid m Check checks if m is a valid prime.
3. Generate Cyclic Pairs which generates all pairs (n,m) where n and m are within the specified limit and valid according to the criteria.
4. Main Function which sets the limit and prints the generated pairs.
